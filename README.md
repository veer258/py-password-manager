# Password-Manager
## A Python Project

A basic password generator and manager to quickly make a 10 character random password and store it in a database. 
To use it, just run the Python file provided and the instructions on how you can use it will be explicitly provided.

### Disclaimer - 
The project is simply to demonstrate how different programs of various complications can be made using Python. It is not recommended to use the program for official use and in real-life scenarios as the database is not secured or encrypted and can easily be read, manipulated or deleted by anyone using the computer.
